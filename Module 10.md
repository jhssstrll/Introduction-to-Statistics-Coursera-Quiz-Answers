## Analysis of Categorical Data
1. Questions (a)-(d) below relate to the following:  Some people suspect that child births may not be equally distributed over the seven days of the week because hospital staff (who can influence the time of delivery in some cases) may prefer to work on certain days of the week. 

Question (a): Which of the following  is the null hypothesis?
> child births occur equally likely on the seven days of the week
2. To investigate, you note the day of the week of 300 births that were randomly selected from all births that occurred in New York City last year. 

Question (b): What test should you use to test the null hypothesis?
> chi-square test for goodness-of-fit
3. Question (c):  What is the degrees of freedom for the test from Question (b)?
> 6
4. Question (d): What would be the answer to Question (b) if you wanted to investigate a simpler question, namely whether the percentage of births on weekends is lower than expected?
> z-test
5. This question and the next one are related to the following context: A food delivery start-up decides to advertise its service by placing ads on web pages. They wonder whether the percentage of viewers who click on the ad changes depending on how often the viewers were shown the ad. They randomly select 100 viewers from among those who were shown the add once, 135 from among those who were shown the add twice, and 150 from among those who were shown the ad three times.

Which is the null hypothesis?
> the chances that the user clicks on the ad is the same for all three groups
6. In the previous question, which test is appropriate to test the null hypothesis?
> chi-square test of homogeneity
7. A county wants to check whether the racial composition of the teachers in the county corresponds to that of the population in the county. It samples 500 teachers at random and wants to compare that sample with the census numbers about the racial groups in that county.

Which test would be appropriate?
> chi-square test for goodness-of-fit
8. An airline wants to find out whether there is a connection between the customer's status in its frequent flyer program and the class of ticket that the customer buys. It samples 1,000 ticket records at random and for each ticket notes the status level ('none', 'silver', 'gold') and the ticket class ('economy', 'business','first').

Which test would be appropriate? 
> chi-square test of independence
9. The airline wants to find out whether there is a connection between the customer's status in its frequent flyer program and the amount that the customer spends on tickets in the following year. It samples 1,000 ticket records at random and for each ticket notes the status level ('none', 'silver', 'gold') and the amount spent on tickets in the following year.

Which test would be appropriate?
> none of these
