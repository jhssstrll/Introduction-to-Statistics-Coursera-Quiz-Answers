## The Normal Approximation for Data and the Binomial Distribution
1. Scores on a certain test follow the normal curve with an average of 1350 and a standard deviation of 120.

What percentage of test takers score below 1230?  (Use the empirical rule.)
> 16%
2. As in the previous question, scores on a certain test follow the normal curve with an average of 1350 and a standard deviation of 120.

In order to qualify for a certain job, a candidate needs to score in the top 2.5%. What score does she need?
> 1590
3. Recall that the main object in a boxplot is a box that is bounded by the first and the third quartiles. So the length of the box is the difference between the third and the first quartile, which is called the interquartile range. This is a measure of spread of the data; it is sometimes used as an alternative to the standard deviation.  

If the data follow the normal curve, then the interquartile range equals how many standard deviations? (You may use the fact that the z-value of the third quartile is 0.7.)
> 1.4
4. A multiple choice exam has 5 questions. Each question has 4 possible answers, of which one is correct. If a student guesses the answers to all five questions, what the chances that he gets 2 correct?

5. A fair coin is tossed 6 times. What are the chances of getting 2 tails in each the first 3 and the last 3 tosses?

6. A fair coin is tossed 400 times. Approximately what are the chances to get more than 210 tails?  (Use the empirical rule and the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.)
> 16%
