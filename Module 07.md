## Confidence Intervals
1. A random sample of 500 sales prices of recently purchased homes in a county is taken. From that sample a 90% confidence interval for the average sales price of all homes in the county is computed to be $215,000 +/- $35,000.

Is the following statement true or false?

"About 90% of all home sales in the county have a sales price in the range $215,000 +/- $35,000."
> false
2. A random sample of 500 sales prices of recently purchased homes in a county is taken. From that sample a 90% confidence interval for the average sales price of all homes in the county is computed to be $215,000 +/- $35,000.

Is the following statement: true or false?

"There is a 90% chance that the average sales price of all homes in the county is in the range $215,000 +/- $35,000."
> false
3. A poll of 400 eligible voters in a city finds that 313 plan to vote in the next election. Find a 95% confidence interval for the percentage of all eligible voters in the city who plan to vote.

4. Questions (a) and (b) below relate to the following: Based on a sample of 500 salaries in a large city we want to find a confidence interval for the average salary in that city.

Question (a): Is it possible to do this using the formula "average +/- z SE"?  (Keep in mind that the histogram of salaries is not normal but quite skewed.)
> yes
5. The margin of error for the confidence interval from Question (a), which was based on 500 salaries, turns out to be $5,400. How many salaries do we need to sample in order to shrink the margin of error to about $2,000?
