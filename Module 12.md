## Multiple Comparisons
1. Recall that a "discovery" occurs when a test rejects the null hypothesis. In the medical literature a discovery is called a "positive result". So a "false positive" is a "false discovery".

What is the false discovery proportion (FDP) of the procedure that yielded the following results:

> 9/9+36
2. A medical study examines whether there is a significant correlation between any of 12 lifestyle choices and high blood pressure. It doesn't find any significant correlation, but upon further examination the researchers find a highly significant (p-value <0.5%) correlation between two of the lifestyle choices. This correlation seems not to have been noticed before.

Which of the following three statements is an appropriate summary of these findings?  Select all that apply.
> The seemingly significant correlation was found as a consequence of data snooping and therefore the p-value is not valid. The researchers shouldn't report anything.

> The seemingly significant correlation was found as a consequence of data snooping and therefore the p-value is not valid. However, this could potentially be a significant new finding. The researchers can report it as such, pointing out that they cannot attach a valid p-value to this finding. It can serve as a hypothesis for a future study with new data, which would then allow for statistically valid conclusions.
3. 1,000 tests were evaluated with the Bonferroni correction. 31 tests had corrected p-values smaller than 5%. 

Which of the following three statements is an  appropriate conclusion?
> This is sufficient evidence to reject all of these 31 null hypotheses, because there is only a 5% chance that any of these 31 p-values would be this small if the null hypotheses were true.
4. 1,000 tests were evaluated with the FDR at the 5% level, which resulted in 31 discoveries. 

Which of the following three statements is an  appropriate conclusion?
> If we reject these 31 null hypotheses then we can expect that about 5% of them are rejected in error.
